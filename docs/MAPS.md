# Map recovery

The original `CMap` object is constructed at `0x0041cac0` and loaded at
`0x0041cb30`. Each map is 13 tiles wide and 12 tiles high. Its 156 signed
16-bit tile values begin at object offset `+0x04` and use column-major indexing:

```text
index = x * 12 + y
```

The checked getter at `0x0041cd80` establishes the bounds and indexing. The
setter at `0x0041cdb0` uses the same formula. Three 156-byte state grids follow
the tiles at offsets `+0x13c`, `+0x1d8`, and `+0x274`; their exact gameplay names
remain unresolved.

## Static maps

The dispatcher at `0x0041e110` selects 112 static loader functions. Each loader
initializes 156 local 16-bit constants and copies them into the map. The generated
catalog at [`assets/maps/original-map-tables.json`](../assets/maps/original-map-tables.json)
records every dispatched map ID, loader address, environment value, and tile grid.

Regenerate it from a current Ghidra C export:

```bash
./tools/extract_map_tables.py \
  --decompiled-dir /Users/baouchiy/Downloads/YipeIII-analysis/decompiled \
  --output assets/maps/original-map-tables.json
```

The extractor requires every loader to produce all 156 values and stops on an
incomplete table. Map IDs `0x76` through `0x78` are generated at runtime by
`0x0041e0f0` instead of appearing in the static dispatcher, so they are outside
this catalog.

## Starting area

Player initialization selects map ID `0x11` and position `(5,5)`. Its loader is
`0x00420e60`, and the dispatcher assigns environment `0`. `yipe::starting_map()`
contains that exact grid. Core tests check tiles at the origin, starting position,
central entrance, and far edge to catch orientation or truncation mistakes.

Movement is reconstructed from the switch at `0x00444c10`. `yipe::try_move()`
preserves its numeric result codes, whether each tile updates the player position,
edge behavior, and the four unresolved player flags used by conditional tiles.
The SDL application renders the starting area with the original 32-pixel tile
art and the type-1 character bitmap. Arrow keys or WASD move the character across
ordinary walkable tiles. Special result codes are available to the core but their
area transitions and dialogs are still being connected.

The start-area renderer currently needs bitmap resources 133, 134, 137, 139,
141, 142, 377, and 418. Resource 406 is the initial type-1 character image.
Tile-to-source-rectangle mappings come from the draw switch at `0x0040cc10`, and
bitmap loading comes from `0x0040b8a0`.
